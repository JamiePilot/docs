## Keys

- Environment-specific keys (sandbox vs production)
- Scoped by role (read-only, write, admin)
- Rotate regularly; avoid embedding in client code

## Usage

Include the header `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` with every request.

```bash
curl https://api.sandbox.pilot.markets/v1/blueprints \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PILOT_SANDBOX_KEY"
```

<Note>
Webhook signing secrets are separate from API keys.
