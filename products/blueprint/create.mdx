title: "Create a Blueprint"
description: "Walk through the Blueprint Builder to generate a copy-ready plan with guardrails."
---

## Prerequisites

- Connected broker (NinjaTrader supported) or linked practice account
- Clear income/return target and risk appetite
- Desired payout cadence (fast vs steady)

## Steps

1. **Connect accounts**: link the trading account you want to model and mirror.
2. **Set goals**: define monthly income or funded-account objectives.
3. **Choose risk appetite**: Low, Medium, or High to tailor daily targets and locks.
4. **Pick payout cadence**: fast (bi-weekly) or steady (monthly) withdrawals.
5. **Generate**: Blueprint Builder produces rules, targets, and position sizing based on history and preferences.
6. **Review guardrails**: confirm soft/hard loss locks, auto sizing, and stop/TP bands.
7. **Publish**: control visibility (public summary vs follower detail) and share for Co-Pylot mirroring.
