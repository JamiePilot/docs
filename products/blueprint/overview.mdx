## What is a Blueprint?

Blueprints are disciplined trading plans that encode thesis, risk, scaling, and execution rules. They power copy trading with Co-Pylot and keep prop-firm style guardrails intact when others mirror you.

## Why traders use Blueprints

- **Guardrails built in**: auto position sizing, soft and hard loss locks, and daily targets that track account size and win rate.
- **Fewer improvisations**: every trigger, stop, and checklist is documented to cut ad-hoc decisions.
- **Copy-ready**: connect to NinjaTrader and publish; followers can mirror with your rules enforced.
- **Confidence to push**: PilotProtect can refund disciplined losses when stops are respected.

## What you get

- Structured strategy definition with versions and visibility controls (public summary vs follower detail).
- Timeline and payout planning to align with funded-account goals.
- Leaderboards that rank by discipline streaks, not just PnL.
- Eligibility to bundle Co-Pylot copy trading and PilotProtect.
