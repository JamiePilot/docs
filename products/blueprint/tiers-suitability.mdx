## Tiering model

| Tier | Strategy profile | Follower gating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | Low complexity, limited leverage, transparent stops | Identity verified, basic risk acknowledgement |
| Tier 2 | Moderate leverage, active trading, options overlays | Identity + trading history + drawdown tolerance confirmation |
| Tier 3 | High complexity or higher-frequency strategies | Prior performance history, enhanced consent, platform-specific approvals |

<Note>
Tiers map the risk of the strategy to the minimum bar a follower must clear before subscribing.
</Note>

## Decision flow

1. Evaluate the Blueprint's declared risk constraints.
2. Assign a tier based on leverage, complexity, and monitoring needs.
3. Run suitability: compare follower profile + PilotScore to tier requirements.
4. Gate access: allow, warn, or block with remediation steps.
5. Log every decision for auditability.

## FAQ

- **How are tiers assigned?** Co-Pylot reviewers map declared risk, instruments, and historical behavior to the tier table above.
- **What happens when a Blueprint changes?** Tiering re-runs on edits; followers may need to re-acknowledge risks.
- **Can we override?** Yes-overrides are logged with reason codes and expiry dates.
