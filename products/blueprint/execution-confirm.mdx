## Concept

Execution-confirm matches stated strategy actions to executed trades. It protects followers by validating that exposure, timing, and size stay within declared parameters.

## Workflow

1. Capture expected actions from the Blueprint or Navigator signal.
2. Compare to executed fills from connected venues.
3. Flag mismatches (size, timing, instrument, price bands).
4. Route to Co-Pylot for review, remediation, or follower notification.
5. Write an audit log entry and update suitability status if required.

## Audit expectations

- Each mismatch includes timestamps, deltas, and who approved remediation.
- Repeat mismatches can trigger tier bumps or temporary follower blocks.
- Followers may receive disclosures when exposure differs from declared rules.
