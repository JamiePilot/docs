title: "How PilotScore works"
description: "Inputs, signals, and scoring cadence for a transparent trading score."
---

## Inputs

- Verified trading telemetry from connected broker accounts (no manual uploads)
- Rule adherence from Blueprint guardrails and execution-confirm
- Strategy declarations from Blueprints (risk appetite, locks, targets)
- Follower impact (aggregate PnL and drawdown where allowed)

## Signals

- Discipline: stop-loss respect, max-loss compliance, no revenge trading
- Consistency: variance from declared style, timing, and sizing
- Community impact: follower outcomes and drawdown, where permissioned
- Risk profile: leverage, drawdowns, exposure relative to constraints

## Scoring cadence

- Real-time updates on rule adherence and execution-confirm events
- Batch smoothing across a minimum of 20 trading sessions to avoid fluke swings

## Explainability

Responses return reasons, dimension scores, and versioned models without exposing proprietary weighting.
