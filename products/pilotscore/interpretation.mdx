## Do

- Use score bands with Blueprint tiers to decide eligibility and copy-trade caps.
- Combine scores with recent deltas to trigger re-checks and pauses.
- Share explanation strings with users to keep outcomes transparent.

## Don't

- Do not expose proprietary model weights.
- Do not gate solely on score without considering declared strategy risk.
- Do not ignore sudden drops; route them to Co-Pylot for investigation.

## Threshold guide

- **720+**: Eligible for Tier 1-2 with standard acknowledgements; higher copy caps and discovery boosts.
- **660-719**: Additional verification or warnings for Tier 2; review queues for Tier 3.
- **&lt;660**: Enhanced review or temporary pause until remediation.
