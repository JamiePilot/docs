## Recipes

- **Top Navigators feed**: rank by PilotScore, then apply Blueprint tier fit and discipline streaks.
- **Copy-trade caps**: raise max mirror size when score >= band and guardrail adherence is clean.
- **Follower eligibility**: `eligibility = score >= band && follower.tierAllowance >= blueprint.tier`.
- **Enhanced review**: route to Co-Pylot when score delta > threshold, locks are overridden, or execution mismatches repeat.
- **Discovery filters**: hide or warn on strategies whose tier exceeds follower profile.

```js
const decision = {
  eligible: pilotScore >= 700 && follower.tierAllowance >= blueprint.tier,
  actions: ["showWarning", "logAudit"],
  reason: "Score above 700 and Tier 2 allowed"
};
```
