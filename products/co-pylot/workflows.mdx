## Platform Ops

- Approve which Navigators and Blueprints can be mirrored.
- Map broker connections (e.g., NinjaTrader) and enforce risk caps per follower.
- Monitor latency/slippage flags and pause streams when quality drops.

## Compliance

- Verify that Blueprint rules are respected during copy trading.
- Audit overrides to locks or sizing; require reason codes and expirations.
- Export evidence for regulators or prop-firm reviews.

## Support

- Help followers understand pauses, caps, or mismatches.
- Provide explanation exports showing which guardrails fired.
- Trigger re-checks if follower profiles or score bands change.
