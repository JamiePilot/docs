## What it is

Co-Pylot mirrors trades from selected Navigators or Blueprints while enforcing the author's rules. Connect NinjaTrader, follow in one click, pause anytime, and keep guardrails intact across followers.

## Key workflows

- Choose a Navigator or Blueprint to mirror and map fills to your account.
- Apply Blueprint guardrails (auto sizing, soft/hard locks, stop/TP bands) during copy.
- Surface latency and slippage flags when fills differ from the source.
- Pause, resume, or cap risk per follower while keeping audit trails.

<Note>
Co-Pylot is built for transparent copy trading: mirroring without losing the discipline baked into each Blueprint.
