title: "Environments (Sandbox vs Production)"
description: "Compare behavior, limits, and controls between Pilot sandbox and production."
---

| Aspect | Sandbox | Production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access | Free, request keys via support | Provisioned after due diligence |
| Data | Resettable, simulated fills allowed | Durable, audited, no simulated data |
| Rate limits | Generous for exploration | Enforced per contract; backoff required |
| Webhooks | Sent to test endpoints, replayable | Signed events with SLAs and retries |
| Approvals | Self-serve | Change-managed with Pilot oversight |

<Note>
Use sandbox for rapid integration and payload validation; production is for verified data and enforced suitability.
</Note>

## Go-live checklist

- Rotate sandbox keys out of code and store production keys in secrets management.
- Validate webhook signature verification against production secrets.
- Confirm audit logging destinations meet your retention requirements.
- Backfill historical trades for accurate PilotScore baselines.
