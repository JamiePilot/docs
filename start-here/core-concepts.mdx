## PilotScore (trust protocol)

PilotScore is a compliance-grade trust protocol and standardized behavioral rating system, like a credit score for trading. It evaluates conduct, consistency, and risk profile using verified trade history, rule adherence, and drift signals.

## Blueprints (tiered strategy definitions)

Blueprints describe a strategy in structured fields (instruments, horizon, risk limits, leverage, stops) and map to tiers that drive suitability. Tiers align the complexity and risk of a strategy to the requirements followers must meet.

## Execution-confirm compliance

Execution-confirm links stated strategy actions to what was actually executed so followers are exposed to what they agreed to. Pilot flags mismatches, records an audit trail, and surfaces remediation workflows.
