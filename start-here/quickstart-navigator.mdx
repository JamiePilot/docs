## Checklist

- **Create your first Blueprint**: describe the strategy (instrument universe, horizon, risk constraints, stops).
- **Verify accounts**: connect your execution venue or provide verified trade history for baseline scoring.
- **Review your PilotScore**: see conduct, consistency, and risk profile plus the reasons that drive them.
- **Set your tier**: align with platform/Broker policies for who can follow and what disclosures are required.
- **Publish**: make the Blueprint discoverable and share the follower link once suitability gating is in place.
- **Monitor**: subscribe to alerts for score changes or execution-confirm issues so you can remediate quickly.

## Tips

- Keep the declared risk constraints realistic-execution-confirm will flag if behavior drifts.
- Include context for followers (time horizon, expected drawdowns, instruments avoided) to reduce support load.
- Re-review after meaningful strategy changes to prevent auto-escalations or tier bumps.
