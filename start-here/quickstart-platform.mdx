description: "7 steps to go from sandbox credentials to production-ready suitability enforcement."
---

## Steps

1. **Get sandbox credentials**: request platform + webhook keys from your Pilot contact or `support@pilot.markets`.
2. **Create a test Navigator**: `POST /navigators` with basic profile metadata to represent a strategy owner.
3. **Attach verified trade history**: link a sandbox broker or upload simulated fills using `POST /navigators/{id}/trades`.
4. **Retrieve PilotScore + risk metrics**: `GET /navigators/{id}/pilot-score` to see current score, dimensions, and reasons.
5. **Apply Blueprint tier rules**: create or import a Blueprint, then gate followers using `POST /suitability/check`.
6. **Subscribe to webhooks**: register endpoints for `score.updated`, `blueprint.tier-changed`, and `execution.mismatch` to avoid polling.
7. **Go live checklist**: lock webhook signing secrets, rotate sandbox keys, enable production endpoints, and backfill audit logging.

## Sample requests

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sandbox.pilot.markets/v1/navigators \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PILOT_SANDBOX_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "externalId": "nav-demo-001",
    "name": "Avery Quinn",
    "region": "US"
  }'
```

```bash
curl "https://api.sandbox.pilot.markets/v1/navigators/nav-demo-001/pilot-score" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PILOT_SANDBOX_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "navigatorId": "nav-demo-001",
  "pilotScore": 732,
  "dimensions": {
    "conduct": 740,
    "consistency": 710,
    "riskProfile": 725
  },
  "tier": "Tier 2",
  "reasons": [
    "12 months verified history",
    "Drawdown within declared risk band",
    "No unsettled execution mismatches"
  ]
}
```

## What success looks like

- PilotScore responses return for your test Navigator with reasons and dimensions.
- Suitability checks block ineligible followers based on Blueprint tier rules.
- Webhooks deliver signed events and your handler responds 2xx with idempotent processing.
- Audit events record Navigator onboarding, score retrievals, and suitability outcomes.
