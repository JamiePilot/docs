# Pilot is the trust layer for retail/social trading

Pilot combines behavioral scoring (PilotScore), tiered strategy definitions (Blueprints), and guided workflows (Co-Pylot) so platforms can quantify risk, enforce suitability, and build transparent communities.

<Note>
PilotScore is a compliance-grade trust protocol and standardized behavioral rating system, like a credit score, but for trading.
