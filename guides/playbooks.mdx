| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook retries keep climbing | Handler not returning 2xx or timing out | Respond quickly, process async, verify signature handling |
| Score drifted unexpectedly | New trades or rule violations | Check reasons field, review execution-confirm logs |
| Follower blocked unexpectedly | Tier bumped or profile outdated | Refresh profile, review suitability response, adjust overrides |
| Missing audit entries | Export window too narrow | Expand filters or ensure SIEM sink is connected |
