description: "Coordinate Platform to Pilot to Broker responsibilities."

## Flow

1. Platform collects follower profile and passes to Pilot for suitability.
2. Pilot evaluates against Blueprint tier + PilotScore; returns allow/warn/block.
3. Broker enforces: block orders, require confirmations, or allow with disclosures.
4. Execution-confirm monitors fills; mismatches trigger re-checks and notifications.
5. Audit logs capture every action; exports available for exams.

<Note>
When in doubt, prefer `warn + acknowledgement` over silent blocks to keep users informed.
