title: "Platform: Rank & gate Navigators"
description: "Combine PilotScore and Blueprint tiers for discovery and eligibility."
---

## Steps

1. Retrieve Navigator PilotScore and tiered Blueprint info.
2. Compute eligibility: score band + follower profile + tier.
3. Rank Navigators in discovery using score, recency, and complaint flags.
4. Gate follow actions with clear warnings and required acknowledgements.
5. Log every decision with reasons for auditability.

## Pseudocode

```js
const eligible = pilotScore >= 700 && follower.tierAllowance >= blueprint.tier;
const uiState = eligible ? "allow" : pilotScore >= 660 ? "warn" : "block";
```
