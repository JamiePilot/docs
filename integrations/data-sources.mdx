| Source | Verification level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connected broker APIs | High | OAuth/keys with trade history, balances, positions |
| Clearing/prime files | High | Reconciled files with timestamps and identifiers |
| Manual attestations | Medium | Requires periodic refresh and sampling |
| Simulated data (sandbox) | Low | For testing only; excluded from production scoring |

<Note>
Verified trade history is critical for trustworthy PilotScore outcomes. Prioritize high-verification sources for production.
