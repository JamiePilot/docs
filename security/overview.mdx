- Least privilege by default across roles and API keys.
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.
- Auditability for every suitability-affecting action.
- Segmented sandbox and production environments.

Data flows from verified sources -> PilotScore processing -> suitability decisions -> audit/export. See [Privacy & data handling](/security/privacy) and [Audit logs](/security/audit-logs) for details.

## FAQ

- **Where is data stored?** Region selection available during onboarding; data stays in-region.
- **How are keys managed?** API keys scoped by environment; webhook secrets separate from API auth.
- **Do you support SSO?** Yes, SSO + MFA for admins is recommended.
