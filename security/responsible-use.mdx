## Principles

- Pilot is not financial advice; always present risks and performance caveats to followers.
- Require acknowledgements before allowing followers into higher tiers.
- Surface score explanations to reduce ambiguity and disputes.

## Suggested disclosures

- Past performance is not indicative of future results.
- PilotScore is one input; users should consider their own risk tolerance.
- Strategies may change; followers should review tier and disclosures regularly.
