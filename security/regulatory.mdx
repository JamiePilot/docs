title: "Regulatory alignment"
description: "Map regulatory problems to Pilot mechanisms."
---

| Problem | Pilot mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Suitability enforcement | Blueprint tiers + follower gating with acknowledgements |
| Misrepresentation risk | Execution-confirm to validate stated vs executed actions |
| Opaque decisioning | PilotScore reasons + logged overrides |
| Recordkeeping | Immutable audit logs and exports aligned to retention policies |
| Consumer protection | Standardized disclosures and warnings before following |

<Note>
Use Blueprint tiers and execution-confirm together to demonstrate suitability controls end-to-end.
</Note>
