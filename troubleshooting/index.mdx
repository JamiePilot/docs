## Top issues

- Webhooks failing: see [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) and verify signatures.
- Suitability decisions unexpected: review [Blueprint tiers](/products/blueprint/tiers-suitability) and follower profile inputs.
- Score not updating: confirm data sources in [Data sources](/integrations/data-sources) and check [Status](/changelog/status).

## Self-serve checklist

- Confirm environment: sandbox vs production keys.
- Check webhook logs and retry headers.
- Pull audit entries for the relevant Navigator/follower.
- If blocked, send event IDs to support for fastest help.
